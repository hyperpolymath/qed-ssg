**Verified static site generation in Agda.**
"QED" — *Quod Erat Demonstrandum*. A site generator where every build is a completed mathematical proof.

== Who Is This For?
* **Type Theorists** who demand that site generation be a formally verified transformation.
* **Logic Researchers** exploring dependently-typed web content.
* **Security Architects** requiring a build tool that is proven to be correct against its specification.

== Why qed-ssg?
=== Proof-as-Generator
In `qed-ssg`, the generator is not just a program; it is a proof that a given set of source files satisfies the "Site Theorem." If the types don't check, the proof is incomplete, and no site is emitted.

=== Formal Specification
Every template in `qed-ssg` is a total function. This guarantees that your site will never encounter a runtime crash or a partial render. The "teeth" of Agda ensure absolute compliance with your **Must-spec**.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Setup Agda via asdf
just setup

# Verify the site theorem and emit HTML
just verify

# Check for holes in the site logic
just check
